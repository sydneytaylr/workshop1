Problem Statement: 

In order for a country to prosper, they must develop their citizens. One of the most important aspects of human development is education. Reading, writing and critical thinking are essential to individual growth, but the overall advancement of a developing country. Throughout the world, literacy rates have significantly increased over the last century. But many developing countries are lagging far behind world averages. Particularly, West African countries still have the lowest education rates in the world. Liberia, Ghana, and Nigeria have some of the highest illiteracy rates in the world which have impacted other aspects of society.  As children continue to lack proper education, they lack the opportuntity to obtain high paying jobs and eventually provide for their families in the future. In West Africa, governments lack proper funding, teachers obtain unjust wages due to low enrollment rates and life expectancies continue to decline. These elements are closely related to illiteracy rates among youth. As Western countries lack the proper resources, the region will forever lag behind their world-power counterparts. So it is important to question why this region has the lowest education rates in the world? What does the gap between this region and the rest of the world say about the importance human development itself? This project will focus on the different factors that separate West Africa from the rest of the world, including societal shifts after the translatlantic slave trade, current socioeconomic issues and the overall importance of child development. 

1. Roser, Max, and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina. “Global Education.” *Our World in Data*, 31 Aug. 2016, ourworldindata.org/global-education.

   ​	The University of Oxford's website, "Our World in Data" conducted numerous studies around the world. The overall goal was to better understand education rates in order to create proper methods for human development. This article specifically focuses on the evolution, production and consequences of education. It analyzes literacy rates, school enrollment numbers, school-life expectancies, teacher attendance and government funding. The graphs represent the essential need for equally accessible education for all, especially those living in developing countries. The lack of resources in developing countries impacts the education opportunities for their citizens. Therefore, the economic, social and political gap between world powers and their counterparts continue to widen. 

   ​	Roser and Ortiz-Ospina brilliantly analyzed school enrollment and attendance with two graphs. In the first graph, enrollment ratios were estimated for those the ages of 15 to 64. This visual provides information from 111 countries from 1870 to 2010. The data was set to compare nine different West African countries, including Niger, Senegal, Mali, Togo, Liberia, Ghana, Benin, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Out of the nine countries, Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leone and Togo had 100 percent enrollment rates by 2010. But, primary school attendance continues to be lessen in many developing countries in Africa. 



2. Obikili, Nonso. “The Impact of the Slave Trade on Literacy in West Africa: Evidence from the Colonial Era.” Journal of African Economies, vol. 25, no. 1, 2016, pp. 1–27.

   ​	Throughout history, West African countries have suffered from the consequences from the transatlantic slave trade. From the 16th to 19th centuries, millions of African men, women and children were violently kidnapped and captured by colonizers. These people were forced to leave their homes and embarked on a brutal journey across the Atlantic ocean and into the western world as slaves. These cruel and violent actions led to the transportation of nearly 10 percent of the overall population in central and western Africa. This not only impacted the lives of the people, it ultimately changed the structure and development of the regional society forever. Currently, West Africa has the highest illiteracy rates in the world. Nearly "40 percent" of the current population cannot read or write. In Obikili's article, he discusses the effect of literacy rates and its negative correlation with slave trade exposure in certain African regions. During the brutal capturing of Africans, these regions lacked national borders, meaning that long-term effects were impacted through ethnic groups, not necessarily countries. Thereforce, Obikili focuses on two regions, Nigeria and Ghana. Both countries have some of the highest rates of ethnic fractionalization, meaning that there are a variety diverse groups found in one region. 

   ​	The slow development of West African countries compared to the rest of the world explains the negative correlation between its lack of success and the intercontinental slave trade. Particularly in West Africa, there are "low schooling rates, underdeveloped financial systems and distorted foreign exchange markets." These factors impact the overall development of children, affecting the success of the region as a whole. Furthermore, Obikili uses his research to understand the need for lifelong education and the promotion of opportunities for all. Throughout the article, he uses numerous graphs, charts and maps to explain literacy rates and slave export intensity and the districts used to collect specific data.

   ​	The World Inequality Database on Education (WIDE) describes the impact of socioeconomic factors that play a role in the global education rates. With an overall focus on the fourth sustainable developmental goal, education rates are analyzed in various countries. The website allows the reader to easily compare the education levels of  different regions by gender, location, wealth and religion. For instance, Ghana has the highest youth education rate in West Africa. With a population of nearly 100 million, about 98 percent of children are enrolled into primary school by the age of 4. As time progresses, only 42% of children complete primary school and 45% complete the upper secondary level. Even though Ghana has the highest education rates in Western Africa, there are numerous countries that have record-breaking low rates. For example, Liberia only graduates 11 percent of their students in primary school and 13 percent in their upper level schools. With a smaller population of about five million, they have a significantly smaller chance of obtaining the same numbers as Ghana. But, their vast differences explain human development in poor countries. 

   ​	This website also provides information about youth literacy. In Ghana, 45 percent of the population are literate while in Liberia, only 19 percent. These numbers reflect the education rates in each country. The more enrollment and graduation of students, the higher the literacy rates. 

   

4. “World Teachers Dat 2019 Fact Sheet.” *UNESCO UIS*, UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 3 Oct. 2019, uis.unesco.org/en/topic/teachers.

   ​	Teachers are vital to the fourth sustainable developmental goal of education. Teachers have the power to challenge the students and are vital to the productivity of the classroom. This article  emphasizes the importance of teaching positions and the lack of resources throughout the world. According to the World Teachers' Day fact sheet, in 2018 only 64 percent of primary and 50 percent of secondary school teachers in sub-saharan Africa are trained. Although, in 2015 the percentage of trained teachers was significantly higher. As more students continue to attend school, the demand for teachers continues to increase significantly. This high demand for teachers affects proper training methods. As more teachers are needed at faster rates, they are not obtaining the proper training to teach effective classrooms. Therefore, poor regions must invest in their educators. This investment will not only improve the development of their students, but ultimately change their community for the better. Better education leads to an improved economy and overall society. This article also emphasizes the importance of classroom conditions. In sub-saharan Africa alone, 34 percent of primary schools have electricity, while 44 percent have basic drinking water. The lack of resources represents the struggles that the students and teachers face while in school. The lack of essential resources causes an increase in drop-out rates. These rates affect the overall literacy rates that separate these countries from world-powers like the United States. 

   ​	While it is extremely difficult to provide proper training for teachers and money for school resources, it is important to recognize the factors that affect human development. This article provides more information about issues that effect education rates including gender-sensitivity, diversity, accountability for workloads and teacher absenteeism. In order for West Africa to extend educational freedom to all, these factors must be considered when understanding human development. The yearly boosts in world population, specifically in West-Africa, will continue to affect the overall education rates. As education continues to be emphasized and highly valued around the globe, developing governments and institutions must understand the fundamental resources required to provide the right resources for proper education.
