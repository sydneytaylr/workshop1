1. Max Roser and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina (2020) - "Global Education". Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: 'https://ourworldindata.org/global-education' [Online Resource]

Education is essential to human development. Numerous countries value education among youth to ensure better opportunities and benefits in the future. But, governments in developing countries lack resources to further youth education. This widens the gap between world powers and their counterparts, ultimately affecting the world's education rates. The "Global Education" article provides detailed comparisons of education levels, including financing, primary and higher education. Throughout the article, graphs include world literacy rates, lack of formal education, school enrollment/attendance, school-life expectancies and more.

I plan to use this article to compare and contrast West-African countries to world powers.
