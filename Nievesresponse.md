Nieves et al. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?
  The random forest machine learning method predicts population density globally. This data is focuses on population growth rates as well. This includes population densities and covariates at a sub-national scale. Random forest regression model is used for each sample country. 

Describe in detail how random forest works.
  Random forest works by using multiple datasets in various locations throughout the world. It uses a regression model coupled with a three step process. This is perfectly described wit
