  The development of a nation is determined by the strength of its social systems. Historically wealthy nations have been able to support their citizens with stable poltical systems and institutions. Although many successful empires have set themselves on the world stage, it was at the expense of many other nations that still struggle today. In particular, the transatlantic slave trade significantly changed West Africa forever. The unjust exploitation of African people and their resources benefited colonizing nations. Belgium, Britain and Portugal were among the few colonizers that used the oil and gold to benefit their economies. The profiteering of resources improved what are now referred to as developed nations. But how did this effect Africa? Today, West Africa has struggled to support its complex systems since colonizing nations invaded their lands. As the poorest region in the world, millions of people do not have access to an education. The strength of a region's academics has the power to improve a region to become more developed. But the "tentacles" of slave intensity and the stealing of resources changed the region forever. When thinking about human development, it is important to understand the importance of education. When studying what has influenced education in West Africa, one must think about the intensity of the slave trade in certain regions. According to Obikili's research, he calculates slave intensity with a least squares regression model. This model takes different factors that may influence the overall impact that slavery has on modern development in Western Africa, or Nigeria in particular. The purpose of my research is to develop a better understanding of colonalism's impact on Nigeria, as representation of the region's response to slave intensity. Further, Obikili questioned if slave intensity truely explains why West Africa has low education rates. While there may not be a perfect answer to his broad question, I want to explain the power of agriculture within certain ethnic groups in West Africa. This type of research is to evaluate why education rates are low. Understanding the cause and effect can help further develop the region in the future.
