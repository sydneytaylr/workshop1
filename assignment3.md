The development of a nation is determined by the strength of its social systems. Successful countries throughout the world have developed because of their strong political, economic and social systems. During the sixteenth century, British colonizers invaded West Africa in search of resources and economic opportunities. Millions of Africans were violently stolen from their homes and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, towards the Americas. This was known as the Transatlantic slave trade, lasting well into the eighteenth century. With the systemic “depopulation” of Africans, colonizers and missionaries brought new ideologies and social practices. Europeans instituted schools, churches and plantations that greatly benefitted their own economies. The transatlantic slave trade alone earned millions of dollars for nations abroad because of the demand for goods and human beings. As the world was benefitting from West Africa, the region struggled to protect itself from violence and systematic shifts within society. Nations including Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia are among the few countries in West Africa that have taken centuries to formulate strong social structures. Today, 64 million people can neither read nor write, making up nearly 40 percent of the total population. These rates are the highest in the world, proving that historical events may have a strong influence on modern human development. 

In order to further understand the relationship between history and human development, this paper will focus on two different uses of a linear regression (OLS) model. This model calculates numerous factors to determine a correlation between two broad subjects. The first version mentioned in this paper is by Nonso Obikili. Obikili conducted a research study that is very close to my original focus, the relationship between slavery and modern education rates in West Africa. In his regression model, he uses multiple factors including agriculture, population density and gender to describe a negative correlation between slavery and education. Furthermore, Edoardo Teso uses a similar equation to understand the Transatlantic slave trade has on gender roles throughout Africa. 

The broad central research question of this paper is “does the transatlantic slave trade, a violent historic event, have the power to impact modern human development in West Africa?” Using both linear regression models will provide more information about the importance of human development in a developing region like West Africa. The impact of the Transatlantic slave trade could explain why West Africa has such low education rates, while Britain is among the highest. Answering this question with the linear regression models with analyze numerous factors throughout history. Can the slave trade be a main factor in the region’s struggle for properly developing their citizens even though it was centuries ago?
