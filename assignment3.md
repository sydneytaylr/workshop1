### INTRODUCTION

The development of a nation is determined by the strength of its social systems. Successful countries throughout the world have developed because of their strong political, economic and social systems. During the sixteenth century, British colonizers invaded West Africa in search of resources and economic opportunities. Millions of Africans were violently stolen from their homes and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, towards the Americas. This was known as the transatlantic slave trade. 

The systemic “depopulation” of Africans, colonizers and missionaries brought new ideologies and social practices. Europeans instituted schools, churches and plantations that greatly benefitted their economies. The transatlantic slave trade earned millions of dollars for nations abroad because of the demand for slave labor and goods. As the world was benefitting from West Africa, the region struggled to protect itself from violence and systematic shifts in society. Nations including Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia are among the few countries in West Africa that have taken centuries to formulate strong social structures. Today, 64 million people can neither read nor write, making up nearly 40 percent of the total adult population in West Africa. These rates are the highest in the world, proving that historical events may have a strong influence on modern human development.

In order to understand the relationship between history and human development, this paper will focus on two different uses of a linear regression (OLS) model. This model evaluates numerous factors to determine a correlation between two separate scenarios. The first version mentioned in this paper is by Nonso Obikili. Obikili conducted a research study that analyzes the relationship between slavery and modern literacy rates in West Africa. In his regression model, he uses multiple factors including agriculture, population density and gender to describe a negative correlation between slavery and education. Furthermore, Edoardo Teso uses a different linear regression model to understand the Transatlantic slave trade’s impact on gender roles throughout West Africa.

The broad central research question of this paper is “does the transatlantic slave trade, a violent historic event, have the power to impact modern human development in West Africa?” Both linear regression models will provide information about the importance of human development in West Africa. The impact of the Transatlantic slave trade could explain why West Africa has such low education rates, while Britain is among the highest. Has the slave trade caused West Africa’s slow development of social systems even though it was centuries ago? 


### INQUIRY TYPE 

This research will use an explanatory inquiry, which focuses on the causes and effects within a problem or situation. In particular, this paper will focus on the influences the transatlantic slave trade has had on modern West Africa. Explaining history's relationship with the current society can help researchers further understand human development. It is important to analyze this relationship because it can improve West Africa and other regions throughout the world that are still struggling to develop. How can we move development forward if developing countries are unable to move on from their pasts? Will West Africa ever be able to fully recover from the transatlantic slave trade and fully develop their complex social systems like education?
Obikili and Teso use the same liner regression model with two separate purposes. Obikili focuses on the Transatlantic slave trade's impact on education, while Teso focuses on its impact on gender roles. Both uses of data explain the aftermaths of the horrific and inhumane enslavement of African people, which has extended into modern society. Currently, the world has entered into the 2020, nearly two centuries after the slave trade was deemed illegal. The fact that West Africa still struggles today shows the impact of the slave trade. It is important to study and interpret the causes and effects of modern human development issues that may have been caused by the "tentacles" of enslavement throughout West Africa.


### MODELS

The first geospatial model is Nonso Obikili's explanation of slave intensity's impact on modern literacy rates. His linear regression model calculates different factors that may have an influence on the relationship between literacy and slavery during the post-colonial era. These factors include employment in agriculture, Christian missionaries, historic distance from the coast, historic population density and malaria ecology index. He found that areas with higher intensities of slavery had negative correlations with low education/literacy rates. This data can be found on Table 9 within his research. 
 
 
 
 
The data above is divided into four separate groups. Obikili does this to prevent any western bias on literacy rates. Column 1 focuses on standard literacy; these refer to a person’s ability to read and write in English only. Column 2 uses extended rates which consists of Arabic, a dominant language spoken throughout Western Africa.  Columns 3 and 4 use both standard and extended literacy rates. All groups show a negative correlation between slave intensity and literacy during the post-colonial era. 
The table above also shows an R-squared calculation, the “statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.” For groups 1 and 2, these numbers were nearly the same at 65% and 66%. This indicates that there is a high variability of the response data sets. This means that the model presented fits the data at about 65.5%. Although, columns 3 and 4 show a significantly low R-squared percentage. Both columns have a 17% ratio, so this model has a very low variability of the response data. 
One of the most interesting and straight-forward graphs in his research focused on the correlation between intensity and each country within West Africa. In a scatterplot, Obikili found a strong negative correlation between slavery and modern literacy rates. Some regions with higher intensities, meaning they were significantly affected by the slave trade and colonization itself, had the lowest education rates throughout West Africa. This graph represents the impact that history has on modern development.




The second geospatial model is the linear regression model used by Edoardo Teso. His research focuses on the impact the transatlantic slave trade has had on modern gender roles, specifically the work force, throughout West Africa. His hypothesis focuses on “the demographic shock to sex ratios- and the accompanying shock to women’s participation in activities outside the domestic sphere – persistently affected cultural beliefs and norms about the appropriate role of women in society” (Teso 7). In Table 1, Teso shows the results of his linear regression model. The data below is divided into eight separate groups. Groups 1-4 represent FLFP, Female Labor Force Participation, while groups 5-8 is Work Outside.
