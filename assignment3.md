### INTRODUCTION

The development of a nation is determined by the strength of its social systems. Successful countries throughout the world have developed because of their strong political, economic and social systems. During the sixteenth century, British colonizers invaded West Africa in search of resources and economic opportunities. Millions of Africans were violently stolen from their homes and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, towards the Americas. This was known as the Transatlantic slave trade, lasting well into the eighteenth century. With the systemic “depopulation” of Africans, colonizers and missionaries brought new ideologies and social practices. Europeans instituted schools, churches and plantations that greatly benefitted their own economies. The transatlantic slave trade alone earned millions of dollars for nations abroad because of the demand for goods and human beings. As the world was benefitting from West Africa, the region struggled to protect itself from violence and systematic shifts within society. Nations including Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia are among the few countries in West Africa that have taken centuries to formulate strong social structures. Today, 64 million people can neither read nor write, making up nearly 40 percent of the total population. These rates are the highest in the world, proving that historical events may have a strong influence on modern human development. 

Nonso Obikili conducted a study to further understand the relationship between slave intensity and modern literacy rates. He used a linear regression model (OLS) that calculates the various factors that define intensity and literacy in West Africa. These factors include missionary influence, gender, agriculture and population density. Each factor has a significant factor on education itself. In addition to Obikili’s research, Edoardo Teso studies the long-term effects the slave trade has on gender roles. Both Obikili and Teso use a linear regression model, which will provide more insight on the impact that history has on modern-day West Africa.
