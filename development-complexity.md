1. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by isomorphic mimicry? 

  Barder recommends resisting engineering as a policy implication for two reasons. First, he says that evolutionary processes outperform the design of the product.

Second, he says that it is "generally impossible to presict what wil happen as a result of a particular change. That makes engineering solutions almost impossible." In order to
