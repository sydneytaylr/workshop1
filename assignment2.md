I. Introduction 

  The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of survey data to generate a proper analysis of literacy rates in West Africa by specifying, estimating and validating a school pathways model. According to UNESCO, this model uses "academic profiles to generalize the average retention and completion of an age group." The school pathways model combined with the use of household surveys and census data provide a better understanding of global education rates. My region of focus is West Africa, consisting of fifteen different countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau,  Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo). With the lowest education rates in the world and a history of colonization, historical survey data can provide a better understanding of the slow development of literacy overtime. I will achieve this through the following objectives. 
  
  1. Use survey and census datasets to estimate literacy rates across all fiften countries along with historical impacts of slave trades during colonial periods. 
  2. Use survey data, national census and country profiles to understand households measured and analysed per country.

  This work will build upon previous research by Nonso Obikili and will incorporate new methods to implement more recent census datasets as well as recent advances towards inferring if colonization and modern literacy gave a direct relationship.
