### I. INTRODUCTION

  The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of survey data to generate a proper analysis of literacy rates in West Africa by specifying, estimating and validating an ordinary least squares regression model. In Nonso Obikili's article, "The Impact of the Slave Trade on Literacy in West Africa: Evidence from the Colonia Eral," he uses a unique equation to determine the relationship between slave export intensity and standard literacy rates. My region of focus is West Africa, consisting of fifteen different countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau,  Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo). Although, Obikili focuses on two countries, Ghana and Nigeria, with similar ethnic groups and levels of slave intensity. West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world and a history of colonization, therefore historical data can provide a better understanding of the slow development of literacy over time. I will achieve this through the following objectives. 
  
  1. Use survey and census datasets to estimate literacy rates across all fifteen countries along with historical impacts of slave trades during colonial periods. 
  2. Use survey data, national census and country profiles to understand households measured and analysed per country.

  This work will build upon previous research by Nonso Obikili and will incorporate new methods to implement more recent census datasets as well as recent advances towards inferring if colonization and modern literacy rates truely have a relationship. 


### II. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TOPIC 
  West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world. Millions of men, women and children do not have access to free, equitable and quality schooling. This affects their literacy, or the ability to read and write in a particular language. Accroding to the UNESCO, literacy is much more than just reading and writing. It is a "means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, communication, in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information rich and fast-changing world." Literacy can be measured by household surveys, standardized tests or a national census. The collection and use of this data is vital to the understanding of human development itself. The combination of high illiteracy rates, low school attendance and inadequate teacher availability has impacted the regions development of citizens. To ensure proper development, education must be prioritized. Therefore, it is important to question why West Africa struggles to support its schooling in comparison to the rest of the world. With a history of colonization, West Africa experienced strong shifts in society and is still recovering. Today, colonizing nations such as Great Britain or France are among the highest education rates in the world. Their economy coupled with their history of academic prestige has impacted modern practices of education. In contrast, modern-day West Africa is still recovering from colonization and struggling to properly develop its complex systems. As the region attempts to support its educational systems, it continues to fall much further behind its developed counterparts. This literature review will focus on different factors that separate West Africa from the rest of the wolrd, including Obikili's explanations of societal shifts after colonization and the overall importance of education itself. 
  
  Education has the power to further human development. Amartya Sen, an economist and philosopher, defines human development as the “emergence of a complex system that provides citizens with the capabilities to live out their lives to the fullest.” Sen firmly believes that societal strength is determined by practices of social freedoms, including education. With the highest illiteracy rates in the world, West African nations lack proper academic opportunities, affecting modern issues of self-governance and global understanding. This development can not only improve individual lives but can change the overall function of a nation for generations to come. With accurate data collection and proper analysis of education rates, student enrollment rates can drastically increase and progress literacy rates. This improvement will create job opportunities, increase governmental participation, improve personal health and the region’s overall socioeconomic status. These improvements will not only impact human development, but eventually change the world’s view of West Africa itself. 
	
  This topic is closely related to the Fourth Sustainable Development Goal created by the United Nations. This goal “ensures inclusive and equitable quality education and promise lifelong learning opportunities for all.” While it is extremely difficult to ensure this for all people, developing nations must make an effort to make this goal a reality. Education is powerful. It is integral to the proper function and development of all. The fourth goal also mentions that “all learners acquire the knowledge or skills needed to promote sustainable development, including… promotion of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity.”  The understanding and overall comparison of this region to the rest of the world will inform others on the impact of education. Therefore, a functional society will develop from a viable educational system. 
 
### III. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
- DESCRIBE THE PROCESS
   
   West Africa is the most populated region in the entire continent. With a total of 386 million people, it is described as the fastest growing population in the world at a "2-4% annual growth rate." The increasing population density makes the region much more vulnerable to the dangers of overpopulation. This includes the scarcity of resources, such as water, food and shelter. As tensions continue to increase, the region struggles to properly support its citizens, making human development much more difficult. Among communities throughout West Africa, millions do not have access to a proper education. Although West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world, each country differs in school attendance, educational opportunities and literacy rates. According to UNESCO's document on Migration and Education in West Africa, "with the exception of Ghana  and Cabo Verde, more than half of adolescents are not enrolled in secondary schools." 
   So what do these low numbers say about West Africa? Moder

### IV. GEOSPATIAL DATA SCIENCE METHODS 

  According to the UNESCO Census, literacy is “beyond reading and writing. It is a means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, communication, in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information rich and fast-changing world.”  Literacy can be measured by household surveys that are used to analyze reading and writing abilities in any particular langauge. In Nonso Obikili's work, he specifically measures literacy rates in Nigeria and Ghana with UNESCO's definition of literacy itself. For validation, Obikili decided to measure two different categories of literacy rates to prevent biases: standard and extended literacy rates. Standard literacy rates specifically focus on the English language, while extended rates include Arabic as well. The extension of these numbers create more accurate datasets that are justly applicable to the studied regions in Nigeria and Ghana. 
  Uniquely, Obikili focuses on the 
  
  Along with literacy rates, the Obikili also uses a different formula to determine slave intensity during the colonial period. He uses data from slave exports divided by the earliest population of ethnic groups reported in specific regions.
