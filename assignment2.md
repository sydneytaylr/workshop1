### I. INTRODUCTION

  The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of survey data to generate a proper analysis of literacy rates in West Africa by specifying, estimating and validating an ordinary least squares regression model. In Nonso Obikili's article, "The Impact of the Slave Trade on Literacy in West Africa: Evidence from the Colonial Era," he uses a unique equation to determine the relationship between slave export intensity and standard literacy rates. My region of focus is West Africa, consisting of fifteen different countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau,  Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo). Although, Obikili focuses on two countries, Ghana and Nigeria, with similar ethnic groups and levels of slave intensity. West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world and a history of colonization, therefore historical data can provide a better understanding of the slow development of literacy over time. I will achieve this through the following objectives. 
  
  1. Use survey and census datasets to estimate literacy rates in Nigeria and Ghana along with historical impacts of slave trades during colonial periods. 
  2. Use survey data, national census and country profiles to understand households measured and analyzed per country.

  This work will build upon previous research by Nonso Obikili and will incorporate new methods to implement more recent census datasets as well as recent advances towards inferring if colonization and modern literacy rates have a relationship. 


### II. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TOPIC 
  West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world. Millions of men, women and children do not have access to free, equitable and quality schooling. This affects their literacy, the ability to read and write in a particular language. Accroding to the UNESCO, literacy is much more than just reading and writing. It is a "means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, communication, in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information rich and fast-changing world." Literacy can be measured by household surveys, standardized tests or a national census. The collection and use of this data is vital to the understanding of human development itself. The combination of high illiteracy rates, low school attendance and inadequate teacher availability has impacted the regions development of citizens. To ensure proper development, education must be prioritized. Therefore, it is important to question why West Africa struggles to support its schooling in comparison to the rest of the world. With a history of colonization, West Africa experienced strong shifts in society and is still recovering. Today, colonizing nations such as Great Britain or France are among the highest education rates in the world. Their economy coupled with their history of academic prestige has impacted modern practices of education. In contrast, modern-day West Africa is still recovering from colonization and struggling to properly develop its complex systems. As the region attempts to support its educational systems, it continues to fall much further behind its developed counterparts. This literature review will focus on different factors that separate West Africa from the rest of the wolrd, including Obikili's explanations of societal shifts after colonization and the overall importance of education itself. 
  
  Education has the power to further human development. Amartya Sen, an economist and philosopher, defines human development as the “emergence of a complex system that provides citizens with the capabilities to live out their lives to the fullest.” Sen firmly believes that societal strength is determined by practices of social freedoms, including education. With the highest illiteracy rates in the world, West African nations lack proper academic opportunities, affecting modern issues of self-governance and global understanding. This development can not only improve individual lives but can change the overall function of a nation for generations to come. With accurate data collection and proper analysis of education rates, student enrollment rates can drastically increase and progress literacy rates. This improvement will create job opportunities, increase governmental participation, improve personal health and the region’s overall socioeconomic status. These improvements will not only impact human development, but eventually change the world’s view of West Africa itself. 
	
  This topic is closely related to the Fourth Sustainable Development Goal created by the United Nations. This goal “ensures inclusive and equitable quality education and promise lifelong learning opportunities for all.” While it is extremely difficult to ensure this for all people, developing nations must make an effort to make this goal a reality. Education is powerful. It is integral to the proper function and development of all. The fourth goal also mentions that “all learners acquire the knowledge or skills needed to promote sustainable development, including… promotion of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity.”  The understanding and overall comparison of this region to the rest of the world will inform others on the impact of education. Therefore, a functional society will develop from a viable educational system. 
 
### III. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
  
  West Africa is the most populated region in the entire continent. With a total of 386 million people, it is described as the fastest growing population in the world at a "2-4% annual growth rate." The increasing population density makes the region much more vulnerable to the dangers of overpopulation. This includes the scarcity of resources, such as water, food and shelter. As tensions continue to increase, the region struggles to properly support its citizens, making human development much more difficult. Among communities throughout West Africa, millions do not have access to a proper education. Each country differs in school attendance, educational opportunities and literacy rates. According to UNESCO's document on Migration and Education in West Africa, "with the exception of Ghana and Cabo Verde, more than half of adolescents are not enrolled in secondary schools." So what causes this gap? Data collected by Nonso Obikili explains that the slave trade, cultural values and their impact on social capital has changed the value and practice of education for generations. 
   
   During the transatlantic slave trades, millions of people in West and Central Africa were violently stolen from their homes from the sixteenth and twentieth centuries. "Out of 28 million people, about 9.8% of the region's population was exported in Africa. This does not include the slaves who died during capture, the long trek to the coast, or the journey across the Atlantic" (Obikili 3). Throughout the 1500s, as colonizers captured innocent people they influnced and invaded Africa's lands by implementing new ideologies and values. Among colonizers, missionaries entered in an attempt to spread their religion through education and social practices. Typically, regions located near the coasts of West Africa were influenced the most and recieved extreme slave intensity in comparison those inward. 
   
  During the colonial period, countries like Nigeria and Ghana did not exist. West Africa consisted of various regional ethnic groups that were affected by the slave trade at different levels of intensity. Obikili terms this focus as "ethnic fractionalism," explaining the power of ethnic groups on the growth and development of individuals. Each group has different values based on their cultures and income levels. For example, in Botswana "schooling was concieved as a burden on the family because of both the new expenditures associated with schooling and the loss of the child's contribution to the household production and income" (Obikili 13). In many communities during the slave trade, many people were educated by agriculture itself, ultimately allowing them to provide for their families. These educational values must be kept in consideration when understanding West Africa's low education rates. 
   
   It is important to note that different datasets define literacy differently. In the Demographic Health Surveys, they assumed that "respondents who had attended higher than secondary education to be literate. All other respondents, shown a typed sentence to read aloud were considered literate if they would read all or part of the sentence" (84). In contrast, the UNESCO Census defines literacy as a much broader term. They describe it as literacy is “beyond reading and writing. It is a means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, communication, in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information rich and fast-changing world.” Literacy can be measured by household surveys that are used to analyze reading and writing abilities in any particular langauge. In Nonso Obikili's work, he specifically measures literacy rates in Nigeria and Ghana with UNESCO's definition of literacy itself. For validation, Obikili decided to measure two different categories of literacy rates to prevent biases: standard and extended literacy rates. Standard literacy rates specifically focus on the English language, while extended rates include Arabic as well. The extension of these numbers create more accurate datasets that are justly applicable to the studied regions in Nigeria and Ghana.


### IV. GEOSPATIAL DATA SCIENCE METHODS 

The first method mentioned in Obikili’s work is a scatter plot with all fifteen countries in West Africa. The graph explains the correlation between slave intensity and literacy rates per country. HIs findings represented a negative relationship that is further explained throughout his paper. First, he uses a least squares regression model. This model helps him determine if there is a true correlation between literacy and slave intensity. 

	- Slave intensity = slave exports / earliest population of ethnic groups reported

The slave exportation was collected from historical documents found from the transatlantic slave trades. These were primary sources. The early population of ethnic groups was collected from census surveys and past datasets collected in Africa during the early 18th and 19th centuries. 

	- Slave intensity = slave exports / land era occupied 
	
Throughout his research, he applies numerous factors of the data collected to back up his findings. Using this method, he discovered that during the colonial era there was a negative correlation between intensity with standard and extended literacy rates.  In Table 2, he found “-5.35% correlation between slave export and standard literacy rates.” This correlation is common throughout all of his research. This table also calculates other factors, including the fraction of those employed in agriculture, christian missionaries and the fraction of females within the region. In his third analysis, he added new factorials  emphasizing the region’s distance from the coast, historic population density, and malaria ecology. The datasets mentioned differentiate in detail, but all three findings have a strong negative correlation with slave intensity and literacy. So what does this say about literacy and colonization? They must have a relationship. 

Obikili also focuses on extended literacy rates. These rates are much higher than the standard rates, explaining that literacy is does not just include the english language. This western perspective of education has impacted past research studies but Obikili makes an effort to change this narrative. In northern districts, Islamic education was a significant aspect of education. Therefore, they had much higher extended literacy rates than in the southern Nigeria. Using census data, southern districts also showed strong negative correlations of education that have been impacted by colonization itself. 
As further analysis, the Demographic Heath Survey provides an explanation of modern literacy rates in each country. Nonso Obikili published his datasets in 2015, but more recent data supports his findings as well. In 2018, NDHS conducted numerous surveys throughout Nigeria. NDHS “interviewed 41,821 women ages 15-49 and 13,311 men age 15-59. The majority of women and men surveyed were under the age of 30” (83). Based on the data collected, men are more educated than women. In Figure 3.1, about 35% of women have not recieved an education in comparison to 22% of men. As the levels of education increase, women tend to fall behind their male counterparts.

Obikili’s data also explains how the transatlantic slave trades impact on literacy was not gender-specific. Obikili uses information from the Nigerian literacy Survey conducted in 2010. This survey measures the literacy rates among men in women throughout Nigeria. He found a strong negative correlation between slave exports and literacy rates for both genders. Out of 37 ethnic groups studied, the effect of slave intensity for men was “-17.10%, while women at -13.24%.”

			
### Discussion 

After researching West Africa's education rates, I have discovered that the region is extremely fascinating. West Africa represents the human development process, the desire for social equality and prosperity. The regions history of colonization is a perfect example of what makes this region so unique. It is a mixture of cultures, values and practices. It is a combination of privilege and poverty with the intersection of ethnic groups. My studies have been extremely rewarding thus far, allowing me to change the narrative of what it means to be literate and step away from western perspectives. Literacy does not determine a regions success, yet it is extremely important in supporting society. The transatlanic slave trade has defined this region in the eyes of many and has created misconceptions about West Africa's progression. Although, the post-colonial period does show that there must be a negative correlation between slave intenisty and education rates. 

In the conclusion of Obikili's paper, he believes that there is no perfect explanation for West Africa's low education rates. His various studies show that there is a negative correlation, yet in the post-colonial period, or modern times, there must be a permanent affect that cannot be pinpointed specifically. So, is modern education rates a social or political issue? Does the history of colonization truely explain why West Africa struggles to support its complex systems? This gap is extremely important because it is at the basis of my research question. Obikili's research was very interesting. It proved that there is a relationship between education and slavery, but what does this relationship exactly tell us? Education is complex and is influenced by numerous factors. It is important that data scientists create analyses that think about the strength of academics among individuals, despite where they live, who they are, or how much they have. 

Finally, I have pitched a research question that represents the purpose of my study:
