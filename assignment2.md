### I. Introduction 

  The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of survey data to generate a proper analysis of literacy rates in West Africa by specifying, estimating and validating a school pathways model. According to UNESCO, this model uses "academic profiles to generalize the average retention and completion of an age group." The school pathways model combined with the use of household surveys and census data provide a better understanding of global education rates. My region of focus is West Africa, consisting of fifteen different countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau,  Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo). With the lowest education rates in the world and a history of colonization, historical survey data can provide a better understanding of the slow development of literacy overtime. I will achieve this through the following objectives. 
  
  1. Use survey and census datasets to estimate literacy rates across all fiften countries along with historical impacts of slave trades during colonial periods. 
  2. Use survey data, national census and country profiles to understand households measured and analysed per country.

  This work will build upon previous research by Nonso Obikili and will incorporate new methods to implement more recent census datasets as well as recent advances towards inferring if colonization and modern literacy have a direct relationship. 


### II. Human Development Topic 
  West Africa has the lowest education rates in the world. Millions of men, women and children do not have access to free, equitable and quality schooling. This affects their literacy, or the ability to read and write in a particular language. Accroding to the UNESCO, literacy is much more than just reading and writing. It is a "means of identification, understanding, interpretation, creation, communication, in an increasingly digital, text-mediated, information rich and fast-changing world." Literacy can be measured by household surveys, standardized tests or a national census. The collection and use of this data is vital to the understanding of human development itself. The combination of high illiteracy rates, low school attendance and inadequate teacher availability has impacted the regions development of citizens. To ensure proper development, education must be prioritized. Therefore, it is important to question why West Africa struggles to support its schooling in comparison to the rest of the world. With a history of colonization, West Africa experienced strong shifts in society and is still recovering. Today, colonizing nations such as Great Britain or France are among the highest education rates in the world. Their economy coupled with their history of academic prestige has impacted modern practices of education. In contrast, modern-day West Africa is still recovering from colonization and struggling to properly develop its complex systems. As the region attempts to support its educational system, it continues to fall much further dehinf its developed counterparts. This literature review will focus on the
