1. In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works? 
  
  The authors created a new technique that is based on a "random forest." THis "nonparametric predictive model" collects large scales of data sets to understand different parts of the world. These random forests are able to collect accurate information that many other methods simply cannot. In order to function properly, this method uses remotely sensed and geospatial data from multiple scales into a dasymetric model. This model provides detailed information of various statistics collected from other methods as well. The authors descided to use case studies in three different countries: Kenya, Vietnam and Cambodia. 


2. The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as a random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events? 
 
 Machine learning algorithms are developed over time. The more the algorithm is used in various data sets, the "stronger" the method becomes. This not only improves the data collected but has the power to impact other methods created in the future. In the random forest method, its algorithm is used to predict per-pixel population density. This information will not only 
 









3. In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general term)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correltes and drivers of human population distributions? 

4. The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

5. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?
